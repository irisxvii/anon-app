# Speak Upüó£Ô∏è: Anonymous Reporting App

A secure, campus-specific mobile application designed for students to anonymously report incidents like drug usage, suspicious activity, abuse cases, and more. The app has two roles (User & Admin) making it easy to use while keeping the data safe.

## How it Works?
1. **Users**
   - Submit detailed reports anonymously under categories like Drug Use, Suspicious Activity, Abuse, or Other
   - View previously submitted reports
   - No personal data is collected, all reports are secure and private

2. **Admins**
   - Secure login for authorized access
   - View all submitted reports in a dashboard
   - Mark reports as Viewed or Resolved
